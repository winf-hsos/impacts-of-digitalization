# Impacts of Digitalization

Welcome to the code repository for the course *Impacts of Digitalization*. The course is originally a module at the [University of Applied Sciences in Osnabr√ºck](https://www.hs-osnabrueck.de/), but I decided to make it publicly available to anyone. You can find all lessons of this course online: [Impacts of Digitalization Online](http://iodi.datalit.de/)
